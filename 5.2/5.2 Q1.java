/*
A student wrote the following method to exchange the values of two int variables.
He then tested the method with the following fragment:
What did the fragment print? Explain.

    }
}

/* Answer
The output will be i = 7 and j = 3. 
This is because they are the original values, therefore they are unchangeable by the method. 
The reason why it doesnâ€™t change is because the parameters are passed to a method. 
When it is passed to a method a copy is made. 
Therefore the original values will remain the same even though the method has changed.
